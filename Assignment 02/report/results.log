I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)

I've inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think
you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.

The control sequence at the end of the top line
of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
